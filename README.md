A repalcement for the abandoned In-Home-Switching.

The desktop streaming client is completely rewritten from before. Currently the the audio is a little buggy but it runs well!
The Switch app however, is a modified version of the [In-Home-Switching](https://github.com/jakibaki/In-Home-Switching/blob/master/README.md) app. The modifications at the moment are a fixed icon for the app, along with touch input.

I will eventually be rewritting the Switch app to give it a new UI and to add more functionality.

For audio, [Screen Capture Recorder](https://github.com/rdp/screen-capture-recorder-to-video-windows-free/releases) still needs to be installed. Kind of like the original [In-Home-Switching](https://github.com/jakibaki/In-Home-Switching/blob/master/README.md).

Other than that there are no other requirements. The virtual xBox controller driver will install automatically on first connection.


TODO:
Now that the streaming app is working, I will be writting a BEAUTIFUL UI for it.
After that is done I will be overhauling the Switch Apps UI.
