# SkyNX
A replacement for the abandoned [In-Home-Switching](https://github.com/jakibaki/In-Home-Switching/blob/master/README.md).
If you are not sure what that is, well, it is an app that allows you to stream your PC games to your Nintendo Switch! Kind of like moonlight. It is not at all entirely ready, and if there were a way to do hardware decoding on switch it would be a lot better. But for now It is definitely, definitely playable.

[Downloads are here](https://github.com/DevL0rd/SkyNX/releases).

The desktop streaming client is completely new. Currently the audio is a little buggy but it runs well!

The Switch app however has it's roots in the original [In-Home-Switching](https://github.com/jakibaki/In-Home-Switching/blob/master/README.md) app.

## SkyNX Streamer

## Instructions:
1. Go to settings and install the xBox controller driver and the audio driver. (If there are any issues with audio or your joycon input, check the Notes section below
1. Set desktop and game resolution to 1280 X 720.
2. Open SkyNXStreamer-win32-x64/SkyNXStreamer.exe
3. Launch SkyNX on switch.
4. Put the IP showed on the app into the streamer.
5. Select a streaming quality.
6. Click start streamer.

## Troubleshooting:
When the streamer connects it will try to connect the switch as a virtual xBox controller, if for some reason the controllers don't work. Try the following steps.
1. Restart windows, and launch it again.
2. If it still is not working. And you have previously used In-Home-Switching, Try removing the ScpDriverInterface that In-Home-Switching installs. You can use the installer that came with it to uninstall it, or get it [Here](https://github.com/mogzol/ScpDriverInterface/releases/download/1.1/ScpDriverInterface_v1.1.zip).

If the streamer just starts and stops immediately, try the following steps.
1. Reinstall the xBox controller driver from the settings tab.
2. Try running it again, if it still fails, restart the system and try once more.
3.  If all else fails, join us in [this thread](https://github.com/DevL0rd/SkyNX/issues/4) where we are pinpointing this issue.

If there is no audio playing, and you have installed the audio driver. Then for now just install [Screen Capture Recorder](https://github.com/rdp/screen-capture-recorder-to-video-windows-free/releases) to have audio. It is a sad workaround I know but I will get the bugs worked out soon.

## Known issues
  * So far Switch crashes when put to sleep with app running, please close app beforehand. It will be fixed after optimizations.
  * App breaks when Switch changes from docked to handheld mode or vice-versa. Please quit the app before doing so.
