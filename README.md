A repalcement for the abandoned In-Home-Switching.

I will rewrite this messy readme when I make my first release. Coming VERY soon.


The desktop streaming client is completely rewritten from before. Currently the the audio is a little buggy but it runs well!
The Switch app however, is a modified version of the [In-Home-Switching](https://github.com/jakibaki/In-Home-Switching/blob/master/README.md) app. The modifications at the moment are a fixed icon for the app, along with touch input.

I will eventually be rewritting the Switch app to give it a new UI and to add more functionality.

For audio, [Screen Capture Recorder](https://github.com/rdp/screen-capture-recorder-to-video-windows-free/releases) still needs to be installed. Kind of like the original [In-Home-Switching](https://github.com/jakibaki/In-Home-Switching/blob/master/README.md).

Other than that there are no other requirements. 

The virtual xBox controller driver will install automatically on first connection.
If you are having issues with the virtual xbox driver not working, and you have used in-home-switching, you will need to remove SCP drivers. just use the ScpDriverInstaller that came with in-home-switching and use the uninstall option.

TODO:
Now that the streaming app is working, I will be writting a BEAUTIFUL UI for it.
After that is done I will be overhauling the Switch Apps UI.
